[install RUST in the site for your system](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
after installation reboot the terminal

# rustc - checking whether the rast is installed
# cargo - checking whether the cargo is installed

# For comfortable work you will need to install two extensions (rust analyzer, code runner)

1) rustc main.rs - file compilation to main.exe / main.pdb (os windows) or main (os mac) or click "run" in Visual Studio
2) ./main.exe - running the compiled file main.exe (os windows) or ./main (os mac) or click "run" in Visual Studio
